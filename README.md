# Crackcrash

Script to scrape the game crash on roobet.

Goal is to find winning/profitable strategies.

The analysis work I did is written up in "Actual Results of Crash" file.

It highlights interesting results and other insights gathered from the data
including possilbe strategies and various expected value calculations


NOTE:
    Since it is not explicitly written in datasets the columns of 15 and 24 hour datasets are 
    [Iteration, Multiplier Value, Time - Measure in seconds passed since epoch]
